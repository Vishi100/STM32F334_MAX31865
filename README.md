# STM32F334_MAX31865
Nucleo64 (64-pin package) has been used for this project. The MCU is STM32F334R8Tx.
MAX31865 is a resistance to digital converter for RTDs (resistance temperature detector).


TOOLCHAIN:
1) Drivers and project generated by STM32CubeMX software (version 4.16.1)
   http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html
   
2) Drivers and examples provided in STM32Cube_FW_F3_V1.6.0
   http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef3.html
   
3) IDE - Kiel µvision (version 5.20.0.0)

4) Driver for flashing - STM32 ST-LINK utility (windows)

STEPS:
The complete preogramming has been done in GUI. 

1) STM32CubeMX -> New Project
   In Board Selector tab, select Vendor(STMicroelectronics), Type of Board (Nucleo64) and MCU series(STM32F3).
   Next, select STM32F334R8Tx MCU from the board list. Clear the pinouts.
   Configure the SPI module and the pins as shown in the Cube file from the repository.
   Go to configuration tab. Now configure SPI and GPIO.
   Finally, click on 'Generate source code based on user settings'. Make the appropriate settings and select MDK-ARM V5 Toolchain.
   Open the Kiel project.
   
2) The C source code has been given in the main.c file from the repository. Copy and build the code. Flash the hex file and you are all set!

3) The output is displayed via UART.


Note: Eliminate the error of +/- 2 degree celsius using other calculations, etc. Separate driver code (MAX31865.c) has been included in the source directory with its header file (MAX31865.h) in the include directory but the project hasn't been updated by making using of them.
